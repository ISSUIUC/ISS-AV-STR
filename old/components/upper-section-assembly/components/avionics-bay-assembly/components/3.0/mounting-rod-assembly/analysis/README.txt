- Take into account the density and cost of material choice
- Safety margins , 1.5x, 27Gs 
- What forces will the plate see at max, ask structures
- Measure rod lengths from top to bottom

- 1/4 inch G-10/FR-4 Fiberglass available, similar to E Glass

Center AC to Center Threaded Rod: 28.5 mm
Stand off Length: 12 mm
Top to bottom AV stack: 205.6 mm


- Weight for lower section
- CO2: According to Seongyong, estimate to be 400 grams, going to simulate 500 grams
- AC: Estimated to be 2 lbs round up to 1 kg
- Bulkheads: 120 g
Total Upper estimate:1.72 kg round up to 1.75 kg about 3.85 lbs

27 Gs x 1.5 = about 40 Gs experienced under safety factor


Force from Lower avionics through rods on mounting plate:
1.75 kg * (35 * 9.81 m/s2) = 650 N, each rod taking 325 N

After simulation, maximum stress: 72.153 MPa
Maximum compressive strength of FR-4: 240 MPa
Maximum tensile strength of FR-4: 240 MPa

Maximum stress much less than strength.
